Applying algorithms to [learn from images and associated text to Barcelona Instagram images](https://gombru.github.io/2018/01/12/insta_barcelona/) allows analyzing which words and images Instagram users relate to Barcelona and different concepts. Since people tend to post more on Instagram when they are traveling and Barcelona is a very touristic city, most of the Instagram data related to Barcelona is from tourist. Therefore, the results are very interesting for the tourism industry.   

[Eurecat](https://eurecat.org/) organizes a tourism forum in Barcelona, [ForumTurisTIC](https://www.forumturistic.com/). I presented there the possibilities of applying my research to tourism analysis in the [inspirational session](https://www.forumturistic.com/ponentes/raul-gomez-eurecat/). The objective was explaining in a non-technical way how the pipeline works and which applications could it have in the tourism industry. Attendants were quite interested in the possibilities.
