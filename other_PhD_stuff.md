### ForumTurisTIC
[Eurecat](https://eurecat.org/) organized a tourism forum in Barcelona, [ForumTurisTIC](https://www.forumturistic.com/). I presented there the possibilities of applying my research on learning from images and associated text to tourism analysis in the [inspirational session](https://www.forumturistic.com/ponentes/raul-gomez-eurecat/).

### Master's thesis
**Automatic discovery of textual information in images from Social Networks using FCN**  
I did the [computer vision master](http://pagines.uab.cat/mcv/) offered by the UAB (Computer Vision Center), UPC, UPF, and UOC. I did the Master's Thesis at Eurecat. It was about reading text in Social Media images. It ended in a text/non-text image classification system and in the improvement of the state of the art TextProposals algorithm, which lead to a [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05089). So in a pipeline to efficiently filter images with text and extract their text regions.
