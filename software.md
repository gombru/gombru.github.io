### SetaMind ###

An Android App that, given a photo of a mushroom, recogonizes its species. Using it is very simple: Take a photo of the mushroom with your phone and SetaMind will recognize the specie and will provide information about it, being able to recognize 24 different species. It uses a CNN that works locally in the phone.    
SetaMind is [available in Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gombru.setamind). Information about the app development can be found in this [blog post](https://gombru.github.io/).
