### Multi-Modal Semantic Image Retrieval Demo ###

A joint multi-modal space for images and words with semantic structure has been learnt from Social Media data in a self-supervised way. This demo lets explore that space, using words and images as queries, and allowing to perform arithmetics between them.       
**[Go to the demo](https://gombru.github.io/MMSemanticRetrievalDemo/)**

### SetaMind ###

An Android App that, given a photo of a mushroom, recogonizes its species. Using it is very simple: Take a photo of the mushroom with your phone and SetaMind will recognize the specie and will provide information about it, being able to recognize 24 different species. It uses a CNN that works locally in the phone.    
SetaMind is [available in Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gombru.setamind).

### TextFCN ###

A Caffe Fully Convolutional Network that detects any kind of text and generates pixel-level heatmaps. Adapted from [FCNs for Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org) by Long and Shelhamer. This came out form my [MS's thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-DM8FPBNpG6QXdQN3JaY3pBMFU/view), and lead to [ICPR workshop](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05089) and [Pattern Recognition Letters Journal](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865517302982) publications.
