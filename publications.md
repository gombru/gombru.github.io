#### Improving Text Proposals for Scene Images with Fully Convolutional Networks ####
Dena Bazazian, Raul Gomez, Anguelos Nicolaou, Lluis Gomez, Dimosthenis Karatzas and Andrew Bagdanov.   DLPR2016. 2016. [PDF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05089)  

This came out from my MS's thesis. It's about how to use a text detection FCN to improve the text proposals algorithm (developed by [Lluis Gomez i Bigorda](http://lluisgomez.github.io/), one of my advisors). The code for the FCN training is [here](https://github.com/gombru/TextProposalsInitialSuppression) and the code for the text proposals pipeline is [here](https://github.com/gombru/TextInSocialNetworks/tree/master/fcn). Watching the FCN detect text in real time is pretty cool.
